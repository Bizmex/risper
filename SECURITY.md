# Our Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, report responsibly by contacting us directly. 


Please note that we will not initiate a law enforcement investigation or any lawsuit against you for the content of the report.

## Sensitive and Personal information
Never attempt to access sensitive or personal data. If you obtain sensitive or personal information during your security research, follow these steps:

‒ **STOP** your research or actions that involve sensitive or personal information immediately

‒ **DO NOT** save, copy, disclose, transfer or do any activity related to the sensitive or personal information

‒ **ALERT** us immediately and support us in the mitigation effort

### Bizmex is a strong believer in the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process and publicly credits security vulnerability reporters for their efforts if they do not wish to remain anonymous.

**Thank you.**
